	<h2>About</h2>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	Hello World!<br>
	My name is David Llanos! I am from Barcelona, Spain and I am 22 years old.<br>
	Currently I'm studying Computer Engineering at Universitat de Barcelona and I'm working as a freelance web developer.<br>
	On my free time I like to make games and join <a title="Ludum Dare" target="_blank" href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/">Game</a> - <a title="Global Game Jam" target="_blank" href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Jams</a>.<br>
	I also like drawing Pixel Art and music. I play a lot of instruments and I even write my own songs.<br>

<h3>Web Development</h3>
	I'm mostly a back-end guy, but recently I've been playing a lot with some front-end features and I'm kind of loving it.<br>
	I'm currently learning <a title="AngularJS" target="_blank" href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and I really enjoy it's workflow. I find more natural to make web sites using a REST API instead of making it in another way.<br>
	I've worked with <a title="Code Igniter" target="_blank" href="http://www.codeigniter.com">Code Igniter</a> as back-end on some past projects and it's super easy to use, so that's why I picked it first, but now I'm learning <a title="Laravel" target="_blank" href="http://laravel.com">Laravel</a>. It's even better!<br>
	I'm also trying to include <a title="Vagrant" target="_blank" href="https://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> in my workflow, as I like to keep my computer clean.

<h3>Game Development</h3>
	I first started making games with Java, I picked up frameworks like Slick2D, LWJGL and <a title="libGDX" target="_blank" href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com">libGDX</a> . But then I transitioned to HTML5. I've used <a title="Phaser" target="_blank" href="http://phaser.io">Phaser</a>, Three.js, Pixi.js, melonJS, Crafty... to name a few. Then I switched to Haxe as I wanted something multiplatform. <br>
	As I like low-level stuff I really hate <a title="Unity" target="_blank" href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> , I know it's awesome but I hate it's workflow. And even though I hate Unity I really like Game Maker! It's super easy and effective to make super fast prototypes! <br>And that's what I'm using right now when I want to make some game dev as I don't have time to code as much as I want.

<h3>General Development</h3>
	I'm in love with <a title="Git" target="_blank" href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> ! And I think everyone should use it!<br>
	My prefered editor is <a title="Sublime Text" target="_blank" href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> but I also enjoy coding on <a title="Vim" target="_blank" href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> as I work a lot in the terminal.
